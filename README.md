# Data Analysis Sample SQL and Power BI Project

In this project I use a data set of car prices in Poland found here https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aleksandrglotov/car-prices-poland 
and visualized it in Power BI. I also trimmed and edited it in Microsoft SQL for convenience. I then created a new table in SQL 
that shows the cars seperated by the eras they were made it. I have attached every single file made and used in this project. 
This project is for practice purposes.
